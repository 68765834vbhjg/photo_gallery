        <ul>
            <li>It Honors His Friendship With Natasha </li>
            <img src=" https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clint-Barton-and-Natasha-Romanoff-in-Avengers-Endgame.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5">
            <p>Throughout their time onscreen together, Clint and Natasha proved themselves to be some of the best friends in the MCU.
            They had years of experience working together and were always ready to act selflessly in order to help the other out, no
            matter what it cost.
            
            After Natasha's death in Avengers: Endgame, the Hawkeye series showed how the loss had impacted Clint, from his reaction
            to an actor pretending to be her in Rogers: The Musical, to visiting the site of their first Avengers battle and talking
            to her, to his interactions with Yelena. Though Natasha is gone, the show holds onto the pair's connection and proves
            how much she affected Clint's life.

                

            </p>
            <li>Elaborating On His Marriage To Laura  </li>
            <img src=" https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Linda-Cardinelli-as-Laura-Barton-in-Hawkeye.jpg">

            <p>
            The surprise reveal of Clint's wife Laura and their family in Avengers: Age Of Ultron was one of that movie's most
            unexpected moments, and Hawkeye allows for far more interaction between the pair, giving viewers more insight into their
            relationship.Although questions about the pair remain, the finale episode confirmed that Laura had been an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
            using the title Agent 19, referring to the comic book character Mockingbird that married Clint and also used the same
            moniker. This explains a lot about their relationship, including where they likely met, and that Clint talks to Laura
            about his work because she understands that world.</p>


            <li> His Value To The Avengers </li>
            <img src=" https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Avengers-group-shot-from-The-Avengers-2012-.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5">
            <p>
            When set against the superpowers of some of his Avengers teammates, Clint's skillset can seem a little underwhelming,
            but Hawkeye showed time and again why having a non-powered hero on the team is so crucial.
            
            In fact, the setup for the whole show relies upon it, as a young Kate Bishop sees Clint fighting heroically against the
            Chitauri and believes that she can be a hero too. Clint's status as the everyman alongside gods and billionaires proves
            that heroism is just as much about actions as it is about money or status, a lesson that might just make him the best
            Avenger in the MCU.
                
            </p>
            <li> A Caring Personality</li>
            <img src=" https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clint-Barton-and-Wanda-Maximoff-comfort-each-other-in-Avengers-Endgame.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5">
            <p>
            Clint has been shown to have a caring personality in the MCU prior to Hawkeye, from his love for his family to his
            connection and motivation of Natasha as well as Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, but this nature of his is reinforced in the
            show, from how he cares for Kate to his determination to join his family for Christmas.
            
            Whether it's through his desire to keep Kate safe in battle or reassuring his kids throughout his time in New York,
            Clint's words and actions are consistently motivated by his care for others. His dedication to righting his past wrongs
            so that they won't impact his family in the future informs his every decision across the season, making him a hero
            that's easy to root for.
