        <ul>
            <li> He Lost His Parents At An Early Age And Was Sent To The Most Terrible Orphanage Imaginable  </li>
            <img
                src=" https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/x-men-origins-cyclops.png?q=50&fit=crop&w=750&dpr=1.5  ">
            <p>
                Losing parents is pretty normal for superheroes. But even then, Cyclops's loss of his parents was exceedingly traumatic. He, his brother Alex, and his parents were flying when an alien ship attacked the plane. His parents gave the two boys the only parachute and they leaped to safety, although Cyclops got a head injury that messed up his powers forever.

                He and Alex were sent to Mister Sinister's orphanage, a place where young mutants were experimented on, their DNA harvested for Sinister's foul purposes. His early life was terrible and while he later learned his father survived, it didn't make it any better.
            </p>
            <li>  He Was Only Made X-Men Leader Because Of His Low Self-Esteem </li>
            <img
                src=" https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Magneto-vs-the-original-X-Men.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=750&dpr=1.5    ">

            <p>
                Cyclops's upbringing in the orphanage and the loss of his parents had an adverse effect on him. Add the uncontrollable nature of his powers to the mix and young Cyclops's self-esteem was in the dumps. Professor X knew that and made him the leader of the X-Men because he was afraid the young man would kill himself.

                Cyclops would learn this fact years later when Cassandra Nova revealed it to him, something that had a profound effect on him. He had to realize that he wasn't the leader because he was the best person for the job, but because he would have killed himself otherwise. 
           </p>


            <li>  He Doesn't Get The Credit For How Great Of A Hero He Is Outside Of The Mutant Community </li>
            <img
                src="  https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/comics-Captain-America-X-Men-Marvel-Comics-New-Avengers-Cyclops-Avengers-vs-X-Men--486192-50.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=750&dpr=1.5 ">
            <p>
                Cyclops has saved the world many times over. He's basically the mutant Captain America, the pinnacle of the mutant hero community. While his fellow mutants, even the ones who don't like him, respect his skills and what he's done, the rest of the world doesn't. Cyclops is a mutant and the world as a whole has always seen him as a bad guy.

                While there have been times when he played into that image, Cyclops has worked hard for years to save mutants and humans alike. He never gets any praise for that, something that he'd definitely get if he wasn't a mutant, and that has to bother him.
