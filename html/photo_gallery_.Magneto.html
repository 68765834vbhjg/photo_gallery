            <li> He Survived The Holocaust </li>

            <p>
                The inciting incident of Magneto's life, the one that made him realize the truth about humanity, was the most terrible event of the 20th century. Magneto was a Polish Jew in the Holocaust, his family taken to Auschwitz by Nazis. When everyone else in his family died, Magneto survived and learned everything he needed to know about his fellow men.

                Surviving the Holocaust was no easy achievement, even for adults, and Magneto was able to do it as a child. He saw and experienced things that no human should ever have to. Magneto did a lot of amazing things but this is one of the greatest.

            <li>  He Gained The X-Men's Trust  </li>

            <p>
                Even after saving Kate Pryde, Magneto had a long way to go to get the X-Men to trust him. This was during the time when the mutant race was drastically reduced and led by Cyclops; while Cyclops had no problem letting someone as powerful as Magneto on the team, trusting a man who had been trying to kill him since he was a teenager wasn't easy.

                Magneto would prove that Cyclops not only could trust him but also that he would actually follow his old enemy's lead. Magneto proved that he deserved to be with the X-Men, helping the team fight against a world that was trying to destroy them.

            <li> Horrific Imagery  </li>
            <img

            <p>
                Starting off light, Magneto is responsible for, what a lot of fans call one of the most graphic comic book illustrations of all time. Back in the 90's, Marvel released the "Fatal Attractions" event, which saw the X-Men attack a new base Magneto had made on an asteroid because he attacked the Earth with a large electromagnetic pulse, causing the deaths of thousands of innocent lives. A large fight ensues, during which Professor X and Jean Grey attack him telepathically with horrific memories from his past.

                During this and whilst also battling the physical attacks, he tries to kill Quicksilver, but before he is able to, he is wounded by Wolverine. Overcome with anger, Magneto attacks Wolverine in the most horrific way. He manipulates the adamantium on his skeleton, ripping it from his body and almost tearing him apart. This had a massive impact on the character of Wolverine, and Professor X had to wipe Magneto's mind, leaving him in a vegetative state.
