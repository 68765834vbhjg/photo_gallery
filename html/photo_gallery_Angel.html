                Warren Kenneth Worthington III is the only son of wealthy businessman Warren Worthington Jr. and his wife, Kathryn. Born in privilege, he grows up to be a somewhat spoiled playboy who still tries to do the right thing. While attending Phillips Academy in Exeter, a fire breaks out, and Warren, wearing an angel costume from the props department, saves his roommates' lives.

                The event makes Warren understand that he can use his abilities for good, and he becomes a superhero known as the "Avenging Angel." His activities soon attract the interest of Charles Xavier, who invites him to join his X-Men.

            <p>
                Angel's transformation into Archangel following Apocalypse's intervention is a landmark moment for the character. He becomes more brooding and stoic, letting go of his carefree playboy days. Over the years, he would struggle with his killer personality, and at one point, he even believes his wings have a mind of their own.
                Warren gets his own "Dark" saga in the form of The Age of Archangel. When Apocalypse dies, the part of him that lived in Warren began growing, essentially turning Warren into a new Apocalypse. During this time, he fights X-Factor and assumes control of the Clan Akkaba. Warren dies after his long-time love, Betsy Braddock, AKA Psylocke, stabs him with a Celestial Life Seed, but his body survives, albeit with no memories from the past.

            <p>
                The new Warren possesses a child-like mind and goes back to mutant school. Unable to understand his true nature, he begins to think that he is a literal angel from heaven, sent to Earth to perform miracles. Warren tries to mend Wolverine's broken legs but fails. Undeterred, he attempts to fly back to Heaven but is unable to and finally realizes he is a mutant.

                During this time, the company's board deems him unfit to run Worthington Industries, and Warren loses control of his fortune. He also befriends a clone of Apocalypse named Evan.
