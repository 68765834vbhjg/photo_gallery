            <li>Focus On Building a Greater Future </li>

                src="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/X-Men-First-CLass-Professor-Xavier-James-McAvoy1.jpg ">
            <p>
                Everyone knows that Professor X is a person who truly believes that humans and mutants can peacefully coexist together. In every X-Men film we have seen this character tirelessly promote the peaceful affirmation of mutant rights. He’s truly dedicated to protecting “the gifted” from dangerous humans, and vice versa.

                I think there’s a lesson to be learned here. Even though a lot of business owners are scared of their competition, they still know that they can never truly destroy their rivals. Having this in mind, isn’t it better to stop wasting energy on going head-to-head with each other and actually focus on creating relationships that will work best for all the parties involved?

                This is basically the whole philosophy behind my link building outreach efforts. I make it sure that my prospects clearly see that we need from each other.

               Regardless of the fact that in today’s digital world websites cannot survive without steady new flow of links, a lot of brands out there are still frightened to feature links on other domains within their niche. Like I wrote above, they’re still scared that they’re going to steal their customers away from them. You and I both know that’s complete BS.

               Generating more and more quality links was, is, and always will be the best strategy for improving your search visibility. Links increase your brand exposure, send positive signals to Google and improve your backlink profile. Quality links also naturally complement your other activities. That’s why Professor X is determined to make everyone get along. Together we can achieve anything.

               So, having all this in mind, even though you might be scared of top players from your niche who target the same consumers as you do, same as the people are afraid of the X-Men and vice versa, the truth is – you need them. Your link building strategy needs them to be as big and powerful as they possibly can be. Only then you’ll truly capitalize from backlinking.

            <li> Mutual Benefit Is the Cornerstone of Influencer Outreach</li>
            <img

            <p>
                As you know, Professor X is pretty good at locating gifted individuals who are not quite that reachable, gathering them under the same roof and making them believe in a common goal. Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters is designed with only one purpose in mind: to round up all the mutants under a safe roof, teach them to only use their powers for good and respect those who are different from them.
                As a person who communicates with a lot of influencers and tries to make them join my cause, I know that there’s only one to talk to them:

               By presenting yourself as a trustworthy source who knows his prospects.

               Before you ask an influencer for a favor, you first need to win their trust. You need to learn everything there is to learn about them, what are their likes and dislikes, so you could present your case to someone that could earn some benefits by contributing to it. If there’s no real value in joining your cause (like saving the world or protecting all the mutants from other nutty mutants), no one will play ball with you. You won’t get an opportunity to write a guest post for respectable blog and you won’t earn that high-quality link if you don’t bring something new and valuable to the table.

            <li> Reclaim All the Broken Links  </li>
            <img

            <p>
                Professor X deals with a lot of mutants on regular basis. Some of them live in his house, other are located nearby. Reading over the X-Men comics, I have learned that a lot of them tend to get lost along the way. Some of them choose to pursue their own adventures, others get kidnapped or tricked to do things that they don’t really want to do, while a few just fade away. Regardless of the scenario, 
                Professor X’s job is to track them down and make sure that they’re ok.I tend to do the same. Links get broken every day and it’s my job to track them down and make sure they start working again. Using such Software like Screaming Frog and Checkmylinks, I track down broken links on high authority sites within a particular niche or industry. Whenever I locate a problem, 
                I write a fresh piece of content that could replace that broken link. Then I reach out to a person in charge of that particular site and offer my content as a replacement for his broken one – for a backlink in return, of course. This strategy works extremely well because no one likes broken links and fresh content always helps bring in new traffic that could, 
                if interesting enough, improve your conversion rates.
