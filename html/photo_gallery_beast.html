                Beast, aka Henry McCoy, wasn't always a furry, bespectacled monkey-man. In fact, Hank was born looking quite human.... except for his ape-like appendages. From an early age, he exhibited signs of his mutation; stronger, faster, and (much) smarter than those around him, Hank became a star athlete and student in high school. Beast tried to hide his simian strength and genius-level intellect as they continued to develop, but was eventually found out and booted from the school.

                It wasn't until much, much later that Hank would find himself fluffed out for good. After years of studying at Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, completing his doctoral studies, and fighting countless battles alongside the X-Men, he accidentally-purposefully dosed himself with the precursor to MGH (mutant growth hormone), turning himself into the Bouncing Blue Beast we know and love. Well, he was gray at the time but you get the point.
                
                Whoops.

            <li> He's Dead in an Alternate Timeline  </li>

                25 Moments, Marvel's viral marketing campaign for X-Men: Days of Future Past, details major mutant events that shaped the course of history. In this alternate timeline, Hank (an ambassador for mutant-human relations in the U.N.) is murdered by an angry mob of human extremists. in the year 2015. The campaign was an interesting little piece of propaganda, especially when you consider just how integral Beast is during the events of DOFP.

                For those of you who missed it, young Beast asks Wolverine (who has traveled back in time, kind of) if he is alive in that version of the future. Wolverine - never one to beat around the bush - let's him know that he's deader than a door nail. Wolverine's actions during the events of DOFP create a new timeline where Beast survives, a fact confirmed by Kelsey Grammer's (Older Beast) cameo in the X-Mansion later in the film

            <li>  Real-Life Beast and Real-Life Mystique Dated and Broke Up. Twice. </li>
            <img

                Oh, Snap: J-Law and N-Ho (patent pending) are donezo! In non-millennial speak, Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique) and Nicholas Hoult (Beast) have ended their not-so-torrid relationship. (This happened years ago, but still.) The two started dating while working on X-Men: First Class in 2011, calling it quits in 2013. Like most couples, they gave love a second chance a few months later... and then split up, again. Classic Katniss, breaking names and kicking hearts.

                Shouldn't be a big deal, right? Eh. Simon Kinberg hinted that Apocalypse will delve deeper into Beast and Mystique's complicated relationship, so that's potentially awkward.
                
                "And the relationship between Beast and Mystique is a really interesting one that we didn’t have a lot of time to explore in Days of Future Past, so we’ll have an opportunity to do more of that in Apocalypse.”
                
                Think he was talking about the X-Men characters or Hoult and Lawrence?
