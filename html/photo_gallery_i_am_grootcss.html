                Groot belongs to the anthropomorphic tree race known as Flora Colussus. Their home, Planet X, is capital of the branch worlds and led by the sage Arbor Masters, which bestows advanced “Photonic Knowledge” upon its inhabitants. This advanced plant education provides genius-levels of intellect to the entire race. It’s unclear whether this know-how extends beyond Planet X, but there’s a good chance the potted plant in the corner of your room is smarter than you.

                For his part, Groot is supposedly a descendant of an ancient ennobled sap-line. While he may have been originally labeled a monster, he also goes by “His Divine Majesty King Groot the 23rd, Monarch of Planet X, custodian of the branch worlds, ruler of all the shades.” That mouthful means he received the finest education from the most gifted Arbor Master tutors, making him super duper smart. Specifically he has a tremendous grasp of quasi-dimensional super-positional engineering, which only sounds like gibberish if you’re not a tree genius. It should be noted that Annihilators #1 suggests that Groot is only pretending to be a monarch, and the events of Tales to Astonish fall under his rebellious younger years, though his birthright has yet to be definitely disproven. Either way, he’s one smart tree.

               As far as monosyllabic sentient tree creatures go, they don’t get any more heroic than Groot (sorry Ents). But when this wooden giant first lumbered onto the scene in 1960, he was as evil as plants come. (Save for maybe poison ivy. That stuff is the worst.) In fact, Groot was nothing more than your run-of-the-mill monster looking to terrorize the planet, like Dracula, King Kong, or the Blob.

              Groot was created by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee, and debuted in Tales to Astonish #13 where he was hailed as the “Monster from Planet X.” Surprisingly verbose for a walking tree, Groot spends much of his time talking about how terrific he is and all the different ways he’s going to defy humanity. This includes such grandiose plans as conquering a small village and subjecting its townsfolk to experimentation on his homeworld. Fortunately, there is a biologist around to stop him. Putting his college education to good use, Leslie Evans quickly breeds super-termites overnight to chew Groot to death.
              In true Groot fashion, he would return over a decade later in Incredible Hulk Annual #5 to fight the Green Goliath.
