            <li> Focus on your progress and your goals  </li>

                Black Widow brings a unique and badass skillset to the Avengers team. If she compared herself to others, that would defeat the point of what she brings to the table.

                In our lives, we may not be on a superhero squad, but with social media, it’s easier than ever to compare yourself to the people around you.
                
                Take the time to think about what you want from your health and fitness journey. You bring your own unique perspective, advantages, and disadvantages to the table. You’re your own character. You can’t choose where you are right now – you’re already here. But you can choose how you move forward.

            <li> Be Prepared Like an Assasin  </li>

            <p>
                It’s when setbacks happen that most people want to (and actually do) quit.

                But guess what: everyone slips, even superheroes.
                
                The difference is, the superheroes correct their mistakes. They get back up and move on.
                
                Just like courage cannot exist but in the face of fear, heroism cannot exist but in the face of difficulty and missteps.
                
                All is not lost for the day because you had a bad meal.
                All is not lost for the week because you missed a workout or two.
                All is not lost for the month because you were sick for a week.  
            </p>


            <li> Be a part of something larger</li>

            <p>There’s a great scene in Avengers: Age of Ultron where Captain America is doing what he does best: Preparing to save everyone knowing he might die in the process

                And Black Widow doesn’t hesitate to join him on the floating rock and sacrifice her life to save others. She knows she’s part of something larger than herself.
                
                She’s an Avenger. She can’t put herself first, and her teammates aren’t just there for her sake. The Avengers have saved the world many times, and Black Widow is a central part of this heroism.
                
                Coming together to help others is the ultimate push to confront the red in your ledger.
                
                We’re all part of our own Avengers team, whether we know it or not.
