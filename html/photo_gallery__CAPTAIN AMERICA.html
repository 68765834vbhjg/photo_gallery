  <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;"> 10 Lessons To Learn from Captain America  </h1>
   <ol>
    <li> Don't Let Our Emotions Get The Best of Us </li>
    <img src="  https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bucky-Barnes-Winter-Soldier-Iron-Man-Tony-Stark-Capain-America-Steve-Rogers-Civil-War-Final-Battle.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5 "> 
    <p>
    The fight between Steve, Tony, and Bucky at the end of Captain America: Civil War is one of the most intensely emotional
    fights in the franchise. Steve is clearly worried about saving Bucky, and given that Tony is so intent on killing him,
    this makes sense.
    
    However, it was still difficult to see how hard he went after Tony at the very end, and this is a reminder for us all to
    not let our emotions get the best of us even in a crisis.
    </p>
    <li> Self-sacrifice isn't always a virtue </li>
    <img src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Captain-America-plane.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5   ">
    <p>
    One of the values that sets Steve Rogers as a character apart is his willingness to sacrifice himself to save others. He
    shows this right away when he's willing to throw himself on the grenade and then again when he flies the plane into the
    ice.
    While self-sacrifice is a good thing, and it's at the core of the character in many ways, he also reminds us all that
    it's okay to fight for and take care of yourself, too.
    </p>
    <li> Let Things Go</li>
    <img src="   https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Steve-Rogers-Peggy-Carter-in-Avengers-Age-of-Ultron-Dream-Sequence.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5">
    <p>
    One thing that many fans were frustrated about in regards to the romantic arc given to Captain America in the films was
    how he seemed to never really get over Peggy.
    
    While this might have made sense if they had really dated, they never shared more than a kiss and the promise of
    something in the future. So, his hang-up over Peggy reminds us all to not get too hung up over our exes.
    </p>
    <li> Trust People</li>
    <img src="  https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/falcon-mackie-black-widow-movie-johansson.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5 ">

    </p>
    <li> Don't Put Too Much Trust In Orders</li>
    <img src=" https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/captain-america-the-winter-soldier-steve-and-natasha.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5  ">
    <p>
    On the other hand, while learning to trust people and being open to that is important, Steve Roger’s journey also
    reminds us that putting too much trust in authority and systems can lead to trouble.
    
    Steve is understandably pretty crushed when he learns that S.H.I.E.L.D. has been infiltrated by HYDRA all along, and
    it's a good reminder to us all to question the systems we are all a part of.
    </p>
    <li> Communicate! </li>
    <img src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Civil-War-Tony-Stark-and-Steve-Rogers.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5   ">
    <p>
    A big part of the reason why the Avengers break apart and the fight between Steve and Tony happens is because they
    aren't able to really sit down together and work things out.
    Tony is also at fault here, but the fact that neither of them can just come to the table to communicate effectively
    leads to misunderstandings, anger, and hurt feelings. Learning how to communicate with people in our lives whether
    personally or professionally is key.


    </p>
    <li> That stubbornness can be good but only to an extent</li>
    <p>
    <img src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/22I-Can-Do-This-All-Day22-Captain-Americas-Best-One-Liners.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5   ">
    <p>
      One of Captain America's other most defining traits is that he's extremely stubborn. This stubbornness is what allows
      him to be so heroic in many ways, and his catchphrase is even “I can do this all day” which speaks to never giving up.
      
      While being stubborn has a time and place, there are also times where it's important to know when you're wrong and stand
      down.
    </p>
    <li> Feel Your Feelings</li>
    <img src=" https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/steve-and-bucky-first-avenger-Cropped.png?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5  ">
    <p>
    Steve is a kind person, but he's also rather private in many ways. He often bottles his feelings up and doesn't actually
    tell those closest to him what he's going through.
    
    He didn't tell many people around him about Bucky, and he also kept information about Tony's parents from him which led
    to the big fight. These mistakes help us remember that being open and honest is essential.

    </p>
    <li> Talk To Your Friends </li>
    <img src="  https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Chris-Evans-as-Steve-Rogers-with-Bucky-and-Falcon-in-Avengers-Endgame.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5">
    <p>h
    Fans were understandably confused and also upset when Steve suddenly went to the past and no conversations about it were
    shown.
    
    While filmmakers said that Steve and Bucky talked about this off-screen, the fact that Steve didn't tell Sam is
    troubling. This mistake is there to tell us all that it's important to be honest and open with your friends.
    </p>
    <li> Live Life In The Present</li>
    <img src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Steve-Rogers-and-Peggy-Carter-dancing-in-Avengers-Endgame.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5   ">
    <p>
    While some fans thought this was a great ending for the character, others were upset at this narrative choice. It seemed
    to go against everything the character stood for.
    
    While missing people from the past is understandable, no one should live in the past. While most people can't actually
    get the chance at a time-traveling do-over, this mistake shows us that we shouldn't spend all of our time dwelling on
    the past and what could have been.
