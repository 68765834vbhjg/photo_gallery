        <ul>
            <li> You really only need one trusted friend
            </li>
            <img src="  https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExd3JwNTFiZXNqOG82bWx0bTMzZmFleHhiZDljcnEwYXV1YThqMnhuZSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/6Kz7ALWos5JBh7Ncit/giphy.gif ">
            <p>  
                I don’t care how much they may have bickered, Rocket always knew that Groot had his back. We never get to hear how deep their friendship has run, but you got the sense that they’d been ripping and running for years, and complimented each other well.

                The internets may base your wealth on the number of followers/friends/likes/retweets you may have, but just know that IRL, it’s those in your intimate circle who can help you become a better person.  
            </p>
          
            <li>  It doesn’t hurt to have a squad, though
            </li>
            <img src="   https://giffiles.alphacoders.com/494/49430.gif ">
            <p>  
                Now while all Rocket truly needed was Groot, he recognized that Star-Lord, Gamora, and Drax really did look out for he and Groot as friends. Once that revelation hit, he was a ride-or-die member of the team. Plus, there was no way that Rocket was going to bust out of jail without the help of the entire squad. Which leads us to…
            </p>
         
            <li> Always plan ahead   </li>
            <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbjA4czJieHI4Z3k5eXA5M3d2b3Jyd3dzbDlidXF4NzFlaXlxMHExYyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/l0Iy2WfPBvUyJQ5XO/giphy.gif ">
            <p>  
                The Guardians didn’t even seem to be in prison for 48 hours without Rocket already having a plan to bust them out of there. He’s mechanically inclined, but he’s also pretty slick when it comes to dropping the right plan, hence the reason the gang got out of jail so quickly.
            </p>
            
            <li> Know your peers   </li>
            <img src=" https://giffiles.alphacoders.com/208/208649.gif">
            <p>  
                Rocket may not realize it, but he was the one with all of the answers. When Star-Lord knew next to nothing about Gamora, Rocket was right there to put him on. 
 
                Now it’s dope to be focused on your bag and how you will obtain it, but you need to be aware of people who are in your lane. There’s no way to crush your dreams than to have them dashed out by someone who you should have been prepared for.
