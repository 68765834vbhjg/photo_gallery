                Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 opens with the team of Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Rocket the Racoon (Bradley Cooper), and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel) battling a giant space alien called an Abilisk. We see Rocket trying to repair a speaker so the team could fight with music in the background. Rocket gives up as Star-Lord tells him the music isn’t worth it. The team returns to the battle while Baby Groot tries to plug in the speaker cord.

                Once Baby Groot connects the cord, the music blares up and the action kicks into high gear. The team devises a way to defeat the alien creature with Drax jumping into the creature’s mouth. Gamora bemoans his action as foolish since he wouldn’t be able to cut through the skin on the inside either. They then notice a cut on the creature’s throat and exploit this weakness to defeat the creature, all with an amazing soundtrack playing in the background.

                After the Guardians of the Galaxy defeated the space creature, the blasted off of the planet. There, we see Baby Groot cooing and plastering his face (and body) against one of the windows in their ship. He was enjoying the journey into space.
                This was probably something Baby Groot experienced many times. Still, he found joy in the routine.

                Why don’t we do the same in our leadership journey? Over time we lose our sense of awe and wonder in what we’re doing. The journey becomes a grind instead of something we enjoy.

               Get back to your roots. Find a way to enjoy your leadership journey again.

            <li>Your words can hurt:    </li>

                Rocket the Raccoon comes across as a tough little critter. He grits his teeth, growls at people, and likes to destroy things.

                Behind his tough exterior, Rocket is sensitive. He’s concerned about the way he’s viewed because he doesn’t feel worthy.
                
                When Rocket was called a triangle-faced monkey, you could see the words hurt him. The look on his face made the viewer sad. The words which were spoken pierced Rocket to the core.
                
                We don’t realize the power of our words. Our words have the power to bring life or death to others. Be careful with your words.

                One of the new Guardians Of The Galaxy team members is Mantis. Mantis is introduced to us as a servant of Ego (Kurt Russell), Star-Lord’s father. He uses her to help him sleep.

                 That’s not the extent of Mantis’ powers. She can also feel the emotions of others and help calm or amplify those emotions.

                After she revealed Star-Lord’s feelings for Gamora, Drax told Mantis to “Do me! Do me!” Drax wanted to see Mantis use her powers.

                There are people who are hungry to see you use your power. The skills you have are valuable to others. And they need you to use them.

               Stop holding back. You have skills others need you to use. Use your skills.

            <li>  Find time to laugh:    </li>

                I absolutely fell in love with the character of Drax in Volume 2 of Guardians Of The Galaxy. He had such a light spirit. He could laugh in any situation.

               There were so many scenes we saw Drax laughing in. Whether it was serious, scary, or humorous. Drax was willing to laugh.

               Laughter does something to us. Laughing can make you smile and feel better.

               Find time to laugh. It’ll do your body good.
            </p>
