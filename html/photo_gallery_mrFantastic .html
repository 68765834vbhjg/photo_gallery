            <p>  
                Reed Richards' mind is extraordinary, allowing him to think up wondrous technology like rocket ships and time machines. He does get tunnel vision sometimes, and especially with the love of his life, Sue Storm, The Invisible Woman.

                Richards is often shown obsessing over a scientific challenge, while Sue tries in vain to get his attention. Despite his getting lost in his work on a regular basis, Reed and Sue Richards remain one of the greatest couples in all comic books, having been married since Fantastic Four Annual #3 in 1965.

            <p>  
                Several variants of Mr. Fantastic exist in the Marvel multiverse, with some of the best variants coming from the What If..? series of comic books. One of the most significant variations on Reed Richards came from the Negative Zone. He was secretly replaced by a double who later revealed themselves to be Brute, a hulking purple figure.

                Brute battled The Invisible Woman in Fantastic Four #182, but ultimately sacrificed his life for the lives of The FF once he saw the way that Reed Richards was loved by them.  
            </p>
          

            
            <li> Failing Values</li>
            <img src="  https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Reed-Richards-best-Cropped.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=750&dpr=1.5   ">
            <p>  
                Reed's actions no longer coincided with his values around the time of Civil War, as he created a Thor Clone and a Negative Zone prison as a member of the pro-registration act. That was only the start of his downward spiral, however, as he went on to be compliant in sending Hulk to space as a member of the Illuminati. It was an act that backfired royally, leading to the events of World War Hulk.

                If that weren't enough, Johnny died during the Dark Reign, after a battle with The Hood's gang over the Infinity Stones. Disillusioned to what he was becoming, he created the Future Foundation, a way for him to do what he always wished to do, better mankind.
